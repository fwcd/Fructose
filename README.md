# Fructose
A general-purpose Java library that extends far beyond the scope of a simple set with utility classes. It provides:

* Math
    * Complex numbers
    * Computation graph differentiation
    * Tensors, matrices, vectors
    * Prime sieves
    * Geometry
* New data structures
    * Proper stacks
    * Tables
    * Trees
    * Graphs
* Machine learning
    * Perceptrons
    * Q-learning
* Genetic algorithms
* IO
    * New File API
* Game AI
    * Minimax/AlphaBeta
    * Monte Carlo tree search
* Quantum computing (just through simulation - at least for now)
    * Superposition and entanglement
* Swing
    * Lots of useful GUI utility classes
* Time
    * Stopwatches
    * Timers
* Small, noteworthy classes
    * Probability distributions
    * Permutators
    * Lazy initializers
    * 2-tuples
    * Annotations
* Properties
* Parsers

## Setup
* Setup Gradle
* Run: gradle eclipse
* Open the folder in your IDE of choice

## Compile
* Run: gradle build
